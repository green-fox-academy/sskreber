Notes to task "Connection with MySQL":

"03. connection-with-my-sql-second" was created because "02. connection-with-my-sql" was not displaying any html file and therefore its other functionalities could not even be tested properly.

Therefore, the second version is a version into which only working code gets pushed, just like I have been doing with my other projects. 

(So, the first version here was experimental and should be approached with caution.)
